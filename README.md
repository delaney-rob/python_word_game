Python Word Game
----------------

This was a college project that was coded in python and then hosted on pythonanywhere. The idea of the project was to get familiar with the python language. This was the first ever project I coded with python. 

The final product can be view here: wordgame.robscv.info

The high score results are merely recorded in a txt file which was a requirement for this project. My intention when time allows is to switch from using the text file to a proper database.
